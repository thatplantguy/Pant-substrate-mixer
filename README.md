# Pant-substrate-mixer
This project would be an inspiration from how a rock tumbler works, a motor drives one axis(speed is reduced via gears) and ontop of that axis a barrel is placed and held between 2 axis
Here is an online photo for a rocktumblwr demonstration 


# Reason For Project
This project has been created to help me with decreasing the amount of manual labor needed to mix substrate for plants and to help with my joints as moving this amount of soil and mixing it all by hand is physically constraining on my back,joints and shoulders
