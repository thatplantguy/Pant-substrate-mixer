# Pant-substrate-mixer
This is a project for mixing larget amounts of soil to be able to plant native flora so they could be used to replant burned down mountains in the South African mountains,this project would be an inspiration from how a rock tumbler works, a motor drives one axis(speed is reduced via gears) and ontop of that axis a barrel is placed

# Reason-For-Project
This project has been started to help me mix soil in larger quantities so I can ploant more native plants to repellant burned down mountains.
maintains here in south africa burn down ever 5+- years so it would be beneficial to get more plants planted to help our native fauna to continue in with life,as the western cape region of south africa we have the world's largest fauna and flora population within a single province totalling 10778 indigenous plant taxation and boasting more than 1500 vertebrae taxa
to help keep these biopdiversities alive and thriving flora is the main part of keeping that system alive and why it is important to keep conservation on point
